<P>
    When it comes to graphic design the main app i'm best with would be photoshop, Youtube. Some of the best type of works i can do are creating videos and editing them Iv'e been doing it for a while for school projects, jobs and for myself. i'm also really into motion graphics and would love to work more on it. 
 </P>
